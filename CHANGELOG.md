# Changelog

## v1.6.0 — 2026-06-19

Rapid-MLX support + a runtime-detection fix.

- **Rapid-MLX runtime** — detected like any other engine (🐇), with its loaded model read
  from the OpenAI-compatible API (`:8000`) and the **"Measure tok/s"** benchmark working out
  of the box. Validated: Qwen3.5-4B (MLX) ≈ 80 tok/s on an M1 Max.
- **Fix — versioned Python interpreters.** The argv gate only matched `python` / `python3`,
  so conda / Homebrew `python3.12` had its argv skipped — meaning MLX (`mlx_lm`) *and*
  Rapid-MLX servers running under a versioned interpreter went undetected. Now prefix-matched.
- Efficiency is shown in **tok/Wh** (tokens per watt-hour — the familiar battery unit),
  the first release to carry the unit change made after v1.5.0.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-06-18

On-demand benchmarking — measure how fast a model actually runs on *your* Mac.

- **Measure tok/s** — a button in the AI Runtime card runs one short fixed generation and
  reports the exact decode rate (Ollama `eval_count`/`eval_duration`; an OpenAI-compatible
  wall-clock for LM Studio / llama.cpp). Also available as `sscope-cli --bench`.
- **tokens-per-watt** — mean SoC package power over the run (GPU-active samples only) →
  tok/J, Apple Silicon's signature efficiency metric, shown beside tok/s.
- **Per-model record** — each result is stored per model + runtime and shown for the loaded
  model, persisted across launches.
- **Light menu-bar fix** — the menu-bar glyph's "SS" label and bar tracks now adapt to the
  menu-bar appearance (they were invisible on a light menu bar).

Why on-demand: current Ollama ships its embedded llama-server without `--metrics` (so
`/metrics` returns 501) and `/slots` carries no decoded-token count — there is no passive
live tok/s to read, so it is measured directly instead.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-06-16

Menu-bar cockpit + chip-agnostic accuracy.

- **Live 6-bar menu-bar glyph** — CPU / GPU / ANE / Media / memory-usage / memory-bandwidth
  as colored mini bars with a stacked "SS" label, drawn as a bitmap for reliable rendering.
  The whole glyph blinks red on an alert (swap, memory-pressure critical, or GPU throttle).
- **Revamped dropdown** — six color-matched trend graphs mirroring the glyph, each on a
  fixed Y axis matched to its bar (no auto-scale exaggeration); memory usage is now a line
  graph; top processes; and an **Open Dashboard** button that brings the main window
  forward from the background. Tighter, denser layout.
- **Honest AI attribution** — the runtime line distinguishes a loaded runtime from an idle
  daemon (`Ollama (idle)`) and an unmanaged in-app / MLX-Swift workload
  (`in-app / unmanaged`); the dashboard no longer credits an idle daemon for GPU work done
  by another app.
- **Chip-agnostic bottleneck verdict** — *bandwidth-bound* is now judged against the
  machine's **own** observed achievable bandwidth peak (self-calibrating across M1…M5+),
  not a fixed fraction of the theoretical spec. Observed peaks (bandwidth / media / ANE)
  decay slowly toward a floor so a one-off spike no longer pins the normalization. The
  theoretical "% of ceiling" gauge stays for display.
- **Compact dashboard** — smaller card padding / heights / spacing and a narrower default
  window.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-06-15

Local-AI monitoring — a dedicated cockpit for people running LLMs on Apple Silicon.

- **AI runtime detection** — recognizes Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, MLX, Jan, GPT4All,
  and vLLM by process (bundle-first matching, sudoless) and surfaces the active runtime
  with its RAM / CPU.
- **Model memory budget** — "largest model that fits now" + "if you unload <model>" (per
  quant), with a rate-based swap/compression risk signal that warns *before* tokens/sec
  collapse (not the static used%).
- **Runtime API (opt-in, off by default)** — reads the loaded model, the authoritative
  GPU/CPU offload split (Ollama `size_vram/size`), and tokens/sec (llama.cpp `/metrics`)
  from `127.0.0.1`. Nothing leaves your Mac. Settings → "Connect to local AI runtimes".
- **AI Workload classifier** retuned against real M1 Max LLM runs (bandwidth-bound at the
  ~50%-of-theoretical regime real decode actually hits) and stabilized with a rolling
  average so the verdict no longer flickers.
- Menu bar gains AI runtime + model-budget lines; `sscope-cli --ai` one-shot probe.

Design + validation: [`docs/ai-local-features-design.md`](docs/ai-local-features-design.md).
The classifier was calibrated against MoE, dense, and memory-pressured runs on an M1 Max.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-06-14

AI-workload monitoring — the next-version hero feature.

- **AI Workload view** — a bottleneck classifier with a single verdict:
  bandwidth-bound / compute-bound / thermal-throttled / memory-pressured (plus idle /
  GPU-active). Front-and-center hero card on the dashboard; mirrored as a `Workload:`
  line in the menu bar.
- **Per-chip memory-bandwidth ceiling table** + a "% of ceiling" gauge (M1–M4; Max bins
  split by P-core count; self-corrects to the observed peak for chips outside the table).
- **GPU throttle detector** — flags the GPU clock held below its slowly-decaying rolling
  peak while thermal pressure has risen (warning banner + menu-bar flame).
- **Compact GPU menu-bar mode** — single line: GPU% / GPU W / GPU GB/s / die °C.

Thanks to @durul for contributing this feature (#2).

## v1.1.0 — 2026-06-14

Renamed **WhisPlayInfo → SiliconScope**.

The project outgrew its origin as a companion utility; the name now reflects what
it is — a general Apple Silicon / SoC inspector. No functional changes to the
metrics in this release.

- App / product name: **SiliconScope** (was WhisPlayInfo)
- Bundle identifier: `ai.calidalab.SiliconScope` (was `ai.calidalab.WhisPlayInfo`)
- SwiftPM targets: `SiliconScope` (app), `SiliconScopeCore` (data library),
  `sscope-cli` (verification CLI)
- Repository: `github.com/kennss/SiliconScope` (the old URL redirects)

> Because the bundle identifier changed, this installs alongside any existing
> WhisPlayInfo rather than upgrading it in place — delete the old app if you have it.

## v1.0.2 — 2026-06-09

Crash fix: launch failure on macOS 27.

- Fixed an immediate crash on launch under macOS 26/27 (`EXC_BREAKPOINT` in
  `Bundle.module`). The SwiftPM resource bundle is a flat folder with no
  `Info.plist`; macOS 27's stricter bundle validation rejects it, so SwiftPM's
  generated `Bundle.module` accessor hit its `fatalError`.
- The app icon is now resolved via the main bundle (with a dev-run fallback),
  removing all dependence on `Bundle.module`. Thanks to @colaH16 (#1).

## v1.0.1 — 2026-06-09

Bug fix: memory-bandwidth Media Engine reporting.

- Fixed Media Engine bandwidth reading 0 while a media-engine app (e.g. video
  transcoding) was active — now classifies the real channels (VENC / VDEC /
  ISP / JPEG / STRM CODEC / ProRes), matching NeoAsitop.
- `MSR` is no longer miscounted as Media; it now falls into Other.
- Total bandwidth now uses the chip-wide `DCS` aggregate, with Other derived as
  total − CPU − GPU − Media, so the parts sum to the real total (previously
  double-counted, ~104 vs ~50 GB/s).
